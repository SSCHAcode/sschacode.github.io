The SSCHA code has just been released in its first distributable version. You can find all the details and installation tips in the code [website](http://sscha.eu/) and [tutorials](http://sscha.eu/tutorials/) that can help you set up your own calculations.

It has been a long journey since the first works performed with the SSCHA theory. It allowed us to perform very interesting physics in hydrogen-based superconductors, charge-density-wave materials, ferroelectrics, and thermoelectrics. It is now time that to open up the code to the community. We believe that opening the code and bringing users to it will help up improve the code, bring new features to it, and contribute to the community with a fantastic tool.
