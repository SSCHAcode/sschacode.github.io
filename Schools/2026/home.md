The second *"School on the Calculation of Ionic Quantum and Anharmonic Effects with the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation"* will take place **online** from June 8–12, 2026. This edition will offer an excellent opportunity to explore the fundamental physics behind the SSCHA code and engage in hands-on training sessions guided by the code’s developers.

This school is ideal for participants interested in learning how to compute thermodynamic, vibrational, transport, spectroscopic, and superconducting properties in strongly anharmonic materials, as well as for those wishing to become familiar with the latest advances in the SSCHA framework. The program will begin with introductory lectures and practical sessions covering the core concepts of the SSCHA and basic calculations. Subsequently, more specialized lectures will delve into phase transitions, spectroscopic properties, thermal conductivity, and electron–phonon interactions. During the hands-on sessions, participants will learn how to compute the critical temperature of charge-density-wave transitions, Raman and infrared spectra of strongly anharmonic systems, thermal conductivity at multiple theoretical levels, and the superconducting properties of materials, even in regimes where the harmonic approximation fails.

All lectures and practical activities will be delivered online. Depending on the number of registered students, hands-on sessions will be performed in different groups in parallel. While no prior experience with the SSCHA is required, participants are encouraged to have some background in phonon theory and familiarity with computer simulations using *ab initio* methods or force fields.

We look forward to welcoming you this June to explore the capabilities and subtleties of the SSCHA.
