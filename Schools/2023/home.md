---

The first *"Summer School on the Calculation of Ionic Quantum and Anharmonic Effects with the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation"* will be held in Donostia/San Sebastián, Spain, from June 26-30, 2023. It will be a fantastic opportunity to learn the fundamental physics behind the SSCHA code and to get hands-on training sessions on its different utilities with lectures given by the developers of the code.

This will be your school if you want to learn how to calculate thermodynamic, vibrational, transport, spectroscopic, and superconducting properties in strongly anharmonic materials. The lectures and the hands-on sessions will focus first on the basics of the SSCHA and first simple calculations. More advanced lectures on phase transitions, spectroscopic properties, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon interactions will follow later. In the hands-on sessions the student will learn to calculate the critical temperature of charge-density wave transitions, Raman and Infrared spectra of strongly anharmonic systems, the thermal conductivity at different levels of theory, and the superconducting properties of materials even if the harmonic approximation collapses.   

Students are expected to bring their own laptop for the hands-on sessions. No prior knowledge on the SSCHA is needed for  participating in the school, but it is advised to have some knowledge on the theory of phonons as well as some experience in computer simulations with *ab initio* methods or force fields.   

We wait for you in the beautiful city of San Sebastian this summer.

<ins><b>How to reach San Sebastian</b></ins>:

By plane:
- Bilbao airport, Spain (IATA: BIO, 100 km. from the city center): About 1 hour drive from San Sebastian. An international airport with connections to all major cities in Europe (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Brussels, Rome,...). The most convenient one for overseas travellers in terms of connections and air fares. A direct shuttle bus running every hour connects the airport with San Sebastián for about 17 euros. The bus time table is available at [Lurraldebus](http://www.lurraldebus.eus) (search between "AEROPUERTO BILBAO" and "DONOSTIA/SAN SEBASTIAN").
- San Sebastian airport, Spain (IATA: EAS, 25 km. from the city center). Next to the town of Hondarribia, about 30 minutes drive from San Sebastian. A small airport with domestic connections to Madrid and Barcelona. Iberia flies to this airport. Convenient when a connection through Madrid is possible. A taxi connecting the airport and the city should be around 30 euros. The airport is also connected to the city center with lines E20 and E21 operated by [Lurraldebus](http://www.lurraldebus.eus).
- Biarritz airport, France (IATA: BIQ, 50 km. from the city center). 40 minutes drive from San Sebastian. Air France flies to this airport, and some low-cost airlines such as Ryanair also fly here. Convenient when flying from France or London. Public transportation is complicated between Biarritz and San Sebastian.

By train:
- The Adif train station Estación del Norte is in the center of San Sebastian, close to Urumea river. It offers connections to several Spanish cities, including Madrid and Barcelona.
- There is also Metro Donostialdea, popularly known as Topo, a narrow-gauge train connecting Donostia with cities along the Basque Coast, from Bilbao and Hendaye (France).

By bus:
- The San Sebastian bus station, which is located by the Adif train station, has lines to cities troughout Spain. The main company traveling here is [Alsa](https://www.alsa.es/eu/).

By car:
- The city is connected to the rest of Spain by the N-1 (Madrid-Irun highway), AP-8 (Bilbao-Irun highway), and A-15 (Pamplona-San Sebastián highway).
