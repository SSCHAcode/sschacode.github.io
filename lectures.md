Here we provide several video lectures 

1. [Theory of lattice vibrations and anharmonicity](Theory-of-lattice-vibrations-and-anharmonicity)
2. [Non-perturbative anharmonicity and the SSCHA](Non-perturbative-anharmonicity-and-the-SSCHA)
3. Second-order phase transitions in the SSCHA
4. Spectral functions and spectroscopic properties
5. Raman and Infrared spectra of strongly anharmonic materials
6. Theory of the electron-phonon interaction and superconductivity
7. Strengths and limitations of the SSCHA: how does it compare with other approaches?
8. Thermal conductivity in strongly anharmonic crystals
