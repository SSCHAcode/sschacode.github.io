In case you have questions about the code usage we would ask you to post your queries in the github *Discussion* page of the *python-sscha* code:

> [github.com/SSCHAcode/python-sscha/discussions](https://github.com/SSCHAcode/python-sscha/discussions)

If you want to become an active deloper of the code and start commiting to the main code your own contributions, please contact us by email.
